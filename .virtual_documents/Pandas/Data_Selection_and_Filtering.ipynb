# First row (by position) -> According to Index

df.iloc[0]      # Same result as that of loc what differnet?

# iloc is useful when we change the row label and now we try with loc we can't pass number we need to give the label of the row or columns but we do this with iloc by using index


df.loc[2,"Film"]          # Use label


df.iloc[2,1]       # Use Index





# Slicing using loc

# Note :- 4 is inclusive in loc
# Note :- This slicing is according to label

df.loc[0:4, "Actor":"Genre"]


# Slicing using loc (Giving list of columns)

df.loc[0:4, ["Actor","IMDb","BoxOffice (INR Crore)","Genre"]]  # New View is according to this order of loc


# Slicing using iloc with index

# Note :- 4 is exclusive in iloc

# Best funtion for easy filter df.query()
