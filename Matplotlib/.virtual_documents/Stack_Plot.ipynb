# A Stack Plot is a type of area chart that helps visualize multiple quantities over time, stacked on top of each other. It's especially useful to see how individual parts contribute to a whole over time.

# From the pie chart we can't be able to determine how much time he spend on TV and total how much time we analize 
# If you want to do this you can use multiple pie plot or use stack plot (recommended)

# This all the thing we overcome with stack plot
